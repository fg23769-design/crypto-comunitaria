Hello everyone!

I’m not a developer but I want to launch a new mineable, open-source, non-profit cryptocurrency. I’m looking for passionate developers to form a team to build:

- Our own blockchain (mineable consensus).
- A native DEX and token platform on the chain.
- Infrastructure: nodes, wallets, explorer, mining pools and exchange listings.

Mission:
- Community-driven mutual project.
- We will mine an initial fund to cover costs (listings, audits, infra). Full transparency (multisig, public audits).
- I’ll help with marketing and exchange listings.

Looking for (roles):
- Blockchain devs (C++, Rust, Go, Python)
- Substrate / Cosmos-SDK / Bitcoin/Monero fork experience
- Smart contract devs and token standard experts
- DevOps / infra / security auditors
- Frontend / wallets / DEX
- Legal / compliance advisors
- Community managers

Conditions:
- Open-source.
- Non-profit, community governance to be defined.
- Mineable (PoW) — parameters and distribution model to be decided.
- Transparency: proposals, multisig, audits before any fund use.

Interested? Reply here or DM me with:
- Role
- Tech/stack and experience
- Availability (hrs/week) and timezone
- Links to GitHub or past crypto projects

Thanks — let’s build something community-driven!
